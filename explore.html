                        <h3 class="hExplore">Take a Moment of Silence at Plaza Cuartel</h3>
                            <img src="pictures/plaza.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                            <p>
                                Plaza Cuartel is a famous historical tourist attraction often included in a Puerto Princesa sightseeing experience. It's a grim reminder of the Palawan Massacre which happened during World War II.
                                On December 14, 1944, Japanese soldiers brought 150 American prisoners-of-war to the shelter trenches (that the prisoners themselves dugout), doused them with gasoline, and burned them alive.
                                The Palawan Massacre killed 139 prisoners-of-war. Only 11 prisoners were able to escape death and were the ones who told the horrifying story. 
                                Today, Plaza Cuartel is an open-air war museum and shrine to the American prisoners-of-war who perished in this mass execution. In the middle of Plaza Cuartel is a marker with a list of the names of the casualties of the Palawan Massacre.
                                Plaza Cuartel is located near the wharf of Puerto Princesa and offers a good view of the ocean. It also has a garden that you can stroll and learn more about its history with the posters installed.

                            <p>
                                Unwind and explore the Puerto Princesa City Baywalk Park (or Baywalk), an open seaside community park where you can stroll, ride bikes, or watch the sunset view. The Baywalk is a famous spot not just for travelers but with locals as well. It's usually included in a Puerto Princesa sightseeing escapade.
                                The seaside promenade attracts joggers and cyclists in the early morning, and a group of friends by late afternoon to nighttime to watch the sunset or try out the local snacks and drinks in the food stalls. There are also restaurants where you can feast on fresh seafood for dinner.                      
                                If lounging by the benches or strolling isn’t enough for you, you can rent bicycles at the far end of the park for kids and adults that you can use within the park's vicinity. Don't miss taking a photo at the Puerto Princesa signage while in the park!

                        <h3 class="hExplore">Appreciate the Architecture of the Immaculate Conception Cathedral </h3>
                            <img src="pictures/cathedral.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                            <p>
                                The blue and white-colored Immaculate Conception Cathedral often included in a Puerto Princesa package is a century-old historic landmark and a famous tourist destination for Puerto Princesa city tours. You can check out the cathedral right after visiting the Plaza Cuartel which is just right across it. 
                                It was first built during the Spanish-era in the Philippines as a small church but was developed into a cathedral in 1961. The majestic Immaculate Conception Cathedral is known for its unique Gothic architectural design that features pointed symmetrical arches that are reminiscent of Medieval European structures.                              
                                Aside from its architecture, the Immaculate Conception Cathedral's historical significance dates back to 1872 when the first mass in Puerto Princesa was held here.                             
                                It was also during that time when the Immaculate Conception of Mary was proclaimed as the Patroness of Puerto Princesa. You can also find some wood carvings from the Iwahig Prison and Penal Colony displayed in the cathedral. 
                            </p>

                        <h3 class="hExplore">Go on a Mangrove Paddle Boat Tour</h3>

                            <p>
                                There's more to Puerto Princesa's river attractions aside from the famous underground river trip. It is also blessed with lush mangrove forests that you can explore on a serene paddleboat tour. Mangrove forests are essential productive ecosystems. 
                                They provide protection for shorelines, prevent erosion, and filter pollutants to maintain water quality and clarity. It is why Puerto Princesa is active in not just protecting these areas but also in spreading awareness about their conservation.
