                    Legend attributes the name "Puerto Princesa" to a princess-like maiden who in the early 
                    days is said to have roamed around the place on certain nights of the year. On the other 
                    hand, practical people attribute the name to the geographical advantages of the place as 
                    a seaport - naturally protected the whole year round and endowed with a depth that can 
                    accommodate any size of shipping - a royal heaven for vessels or a virtual princess of 
                    ports as thus indicated by Spanish Colonizers on the country's map. Historically, the 
                    place was named after Princess Asunción, born in 1864 to Queen Isabella II and her 
                    consort, Francisco de Cádiz. When the princess suffered an untimely death, the Queen 
                    changed the name to Puerto de la Princesa. Eventually, the name was reduced to Puerto 
                    Princesa as it is known today.

                    Spanish Colonizers founded the settlement on 4 March 1872 in the course of their exploration
                    of the province. As they scanned the Palawan shoreline for a capital site, they came upon a 
                    hill with steep declivity. Rowing to shore, they surveyed the hill and discovered an extensive
                    plateau which they decided as ideal for settlement. Soon after, Fr. Antonio Muro levelled 
                    a portion of the hill to make way for a chapel. (That section is now occupied by the 
                    Catholic Cathedral, the P.C. Barracks and the Rizal Park. The Old Municipal Building used 
                    to be there, as well as an Elementary School). The first mass celebrated in Puerto Princesa
                     took place at a site where a marker now stands.

                    In 1911, the New American Administration made Puerto Princesa the seat of the Palawan 
                    Provincial Government with Major John Brown as Lieutenant Governor.In 1951, the barrios 
                    of Tinitian, Caramay, Rizal, Del Pilar, Malcampo, Tumarbong, Taradungan, Ilian, and Capayas were separated to form the town of Roxas. 
                    In 1955, the sitios of Materingen, Tandayag, Nasedoc, and Panlawagan were separated from the barrio of 
                    Maroyogon and elevated into a barrio. In 1956, the sitios of Calagbenguen, Tarabanan, 
                    Bendoyan, Talabigan, Tagbuan, and Langogan were constituted into the barrio of Concepcion.
                    In 1957, the barrio of Tapul was renamed to Salvacion.

                <p>
                    The town was converted into a city on 1 January 1970 under R.A. 5906 as amended by P.D. 437, 
                    through the effort of then Congressman Ramon V. Mitra, Jr. Feliberto R. Oliveros, Jr. became the 
                    first City Mayor. Since its foundation, Puerto Princesa has been the nerve center of activities 
                    in Palawan. Aside from being the seat of public administration, it is the heart of trade, commerce, 
                    service, and industry in the province. Today, the City has gained the distinction of being a model 
                    city - in cleanliness, environmental protection and conservation, and local governance in general.
                    And so, with a responsive leadership and an inspired citizenry, the tradition of Puerto Princesa 
                    being a beautiful and clean city lives on.
